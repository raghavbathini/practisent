Write a java program to find the most repeated word in text file. Your program should take one text file as input and find out the most repeated word in that file.
1. Write a function for merging two sorted arrays? What is the time complexity of your written solution in terms of Big O notations?
2. Write a program for In-Order traversal of a Simple Tree.
a. Can you do this without recursion logic? 
b. Which data structure is used behind the scenes when recursion is used? Can you try using that data structure?
3. Write logic to convert a simple Binary Tree into its' mirror image. (Swap left and right nodes)
4. Binary Tree : Array ([4,2,5,1,3]) which already has a binary tree format data. You need to print a sorted array using tree mechanism so that it is fast?
5. Write a code to determine whether the input Trees is a Binary Tree?
6. Find the occurrence of each character in the given string. Print in the occurrences in sorted order.
7. Single LinkedList…  You don’t' know the size of the linked list. You need the get to the third last node of the list.
8. If I have a 2 dimensional array with 0s and 1s ; sorted rows; length is same. You need to find out which  the row with max number of ones?
9. Single dimension int array having random values. Write a program to find pairs of values in the array whose sum if equal to k. 
Others:
1. Write a program to count frequency of characters in a given string and How to get the output of this in insertion order? Write Junit test case for above and in JUnit method iterate the map and check using JUnit if the output is correct? Add your custom exception handling for same.
2. Write a code to create a socket connection in Java? Write a Junit test case for same.
3. Write a code to decide the election winner, conditions are-
a. The candidate who has more alphabets in name would be winner (example – ASHISH SHARMA has 6 alphabets in name which are A, S, H, I, R, M)
b. The alphabet entered as input are in capital later
c. We can have multiple elections at the same time so program (input/output) should be designed to handle this as well
d. Unit test cases for all possible scenarios.
4. Write a code to decide largest difference of two number in an array, conditions are-
a. It is an integer array.
b. A[i] < A[J] where i<j
Example: Array = 2, 6, 10, 3, 9 answer is  8
5. Write a code to provide two outputs from an input (an integer array)
a. Have to use an intermediate data structure (collection) say X
Output needed:
Number of occurrences of an integer in array by using X
Recreation of initial array by using X
The program should be justifiable on time/space complexity.
6. Java and Junit code to bubble sort the integer array.
7. Java and Junit code to find the number of occurrences of characters in a String.  Character orders should be maintained.
8. Find repetitive alphabets in  a string. Example: input: aabcdehh output: collection of characters (a,h)
9. Write Java Code to find whether two strings are anagram or not.
In above Code add Custom Exception for all the invalid cases.
Write Junit for the above Code.
10. Write a program to sort Employee based on id or name.
